Why is a stack the right choice for undo/redo?
Why is a queue better suited for the help desk?
How do your implementations differ from Pythonâ€™s built-in lists?
Be sure to review Resource #3: When to Use a Stack or a Queue to help in answering these questions!


A stack is the right choice for undo/redo when you the most recent action needs to be handled first. For example for undo/redo
you are usually undoing or redoing the last action that you completed. This would make a stack useful because it follows the last in first
out principle. 

The queue is better suited for the help desk because in this situation fairness matters. The customers are treated first come first handled.
This meaning that the first in first out princilple is needed. 

From my understanding, using a linked list version of a stack or queue can be a lot faster than using a built in python list or array. 
This is because of how it handles memory. When removing items from a built in python list, the other elements in the list will need to be shifted.
Python list are generally fast for end operations and also random access since elements can be accessed by index
